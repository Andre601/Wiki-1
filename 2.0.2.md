# Details
### ItemFlags in Kits
[ItemFlags](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/inventory/ItemFlag.html) can be added to kits now by using:

`itemflags:flag1` OR

`itemflags:flag1,flag2`

### kits.yml
When you run 2.0.2 for the first time, your kits in your `config.yml` will automatically be migrated to a new `kits.yml` file. Once the migration has taken place, you can safely delete the kits section of your config.yml as it is not used anymore.

`/createkit` is a command that we've had for almost 3 years at the time of this posting. You can now create kits using this in game command without worrying about messing up the formatting of your config.yml! We will be expanding the functionality of /createkit in the future.
