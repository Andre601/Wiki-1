**Commands list:** https://essinfo.xeya.me/commands.php  
**Permissions list:** https://essinfo.xeya.me/permissions.php

**Note:** When updating EssentialsX, you need to update *all* the modules to the same version to prevent version mismatch errors. In addition, you may want to update your config file - the latest config file can always be found [here](https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials/blob/2.x/Essentials/src/config.yml).

## The original Essentials

EssentialsX is a fork of the original [Essentials](https://github.com/essentials/Essentials), which was discontinued in 2014. Most commands and permissions work the same way - you can find changes on the [Improvements](Improvements) page and [changelogs](Changelogs). When upgrading from Essentials, simply replace the Essentials jars with the equivalent EssentialsX jars - your old Essentials files are compatible with EssentialsX and will be updated when you first run EssentialsX.
