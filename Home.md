# EssentialsX wiki!

EssentialsX is a fork of the original [Essentials](https://github.com/essentials/Essentials). Most commands and permissions work the same way. Old Essentials files are compatible with EssentialsX and will be updated when you first run EssentialsX

**Commands list:** https://essinfo.xeya.me/commands.php  
**Permissions list:** https://essinfo.xeya.me/permissions.php

**Note:** When updating EssentialsX, you need to update *all* the modules to the same version to prevent version mismatch errors. In addition, you may want to update your config file - the latest config file can always be found [here](https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials/blob/2.x/Essentials/src/config.yml).

### What is/was Essentials?

Essentials is a Minecraft plugin that provides a number of "essential" features and commands to help with managing Minecraft servers.  Most new commands can be permissions-restricted to only certain users or groups.  

**The Essentials plugin ceased development after Minecraft 1.7, and no further releases were made for newer Minecraft editions.**  Hence, EssentialsX.

Some of the features provided by Essentials include:

* Player made homes, and server warps.
* Player kits and first join kits
* Easy player to player teleports, including teleport requests.
* Full chat and nickname customisation
* Full moderator control, with feature such as muting, jailing and temp banning
* Economy support, including shop signs and command costs
* Full permission based build control, with the ability to block certain items
* Core world protection, allowing you to block explosions, fire spread, and other catastrophes
